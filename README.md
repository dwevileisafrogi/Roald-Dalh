# Roald-Dalh
ahhhhhh
Hello everyone! Today I will be talking about Roal Dahl. Roal Dahl is famous for writing award winning books like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, James And the Giant Peach, and so many more. One character trait that Roal Dahl exhibited was that he was mischievous. He was always getting into trouble. Like one time, Roal Dahl and his friends put a mouse in the gobstopper jar in a candy shop. I would like to know Roal Dahl instead of being his friend because he was mischievous and deceptive.
